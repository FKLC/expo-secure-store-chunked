# Expo Secure Store Chunked
Store longer secure content by chunking it into smaller parts.

### Installation
```properties
npx expo install expo-secure-store
````

### Usage
API is the same as the [original package](https://github.com/expo/expo/tree/sdk-49/packages/expo-secure-store), so you can just use the original documentation. Note that this library only exports `deleteItemAsync`, `getItemAsync`, `setItemAsync` functions.
